# Homework 5 - Improving the Pipeline Again

## What files do I look at?
- `pipeline_library.py` is the python library of functions I wrote for exploration, cleaning, preprocessing, model training and validation.
- `pipeline_config.py` is the python file containing hard-coded variables used throughout the pipeline.
- `Homework5_Tan.ipynb` demonstrates new pipeline functions written for this assignment, documents my pipeline in use (data exploration, data processing choices, feature selection, training, etc.) for predicting which DonorsChoose projects will be funded within 60 days of posting, and includes a short report of recommendations on how to use it.

## Notes for this submission
- The `/data` directory stores data used in this assignment.
- The `/output` directory stores graph outputs from various models, as well as an excel file of the final table of classifiers and evaluation metrics.
