# Homework 2 - Machine Learning Pipeline

## What files do I look at?
- `pipeline_library.py` is the python library of functions I wrote for exploration, cleaning, and preprocessing.
- `pipeline_config.py` is the python file containing hard-coded variables used throughout the pipeline.
- `Homework2_Tan.ipynb` is the IPython notebook that contains demonstrations of functions in `pipeline_library.py`, results of training a simple Decision Tree classifier on the data, and my writeup of the process.

## Notes for this submission
- The `/data` directory stores data used in this assignment.
- The `/output` directory stores the outputs from the Decision Tree classifier, including a `.pdf` representation of the final Decision Tree.
